#Currently this is still a WIP as I'm still building and waiting for parts, this should get you on your way however.

##First I want to state that I create nothing but the 3d files for the case!
See this as a buildguide for myself in the future in case I want to recreate it.

Since this is based on the Sanni V3 here are the links to their info:

Makho's Instructional video how he created this: (All links below for Makho can be found in the description of the video)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCagzAQVYlU (I recommend using sockets for everything if you're going to follow the video so that it will fit the case)

Makho's list of materials needed:
(For Female sockets I've used standard rows which I cut to length, detailed later)

The Gerber files should be 1.6mm. I payed 12.3â‚¬ incl shipping to Europe for 5.

##Once everything is arrived from the list it's time to start building. 
###Soldering the underside.
The first thing you should do is attach the resistors or the buttons won't work. 
10k ohm resistor with code 103.

Because afterwards it can get crowded

For the oled screen you must set the jumpers depending on your model.
My screen was GND-VCC-SCL-SDA

JP2 should be set to GND and JP1 to VCC as show below. If yours is switched, you should switch the bridging:

- Start with the voltage regulator in red.
- The USB C charging port (which is missing because I forgot to order it)

- The sockets for the sd card depending on your model, I have a MicroSD
- The sockets for the Arduino (If you're not gonna use sockets, this is the time for the buttons else can be done later)
- The buttons
- The battery terminals
It should look something like this:

The 5V to 3.3V step-down converter should be installed like this:
5v   in
3.3v out

For the sd cardreader I've chosen to not bend the pins but to solder straight pins in:

###Soldering the top
If you haven't soldered in the buttons yet, now is the time.
There are multiple choices for buttons, I went with what I had laying around. Ajazz Bananas in this case.
Solder the following components:
- 4-pin socket for the Oled screen
- The Led (The longest lead goes through the hole marked VCC)
- The GB cart slot
If you're finished it should look something like:

###Populating the board.

I put the pins in the sockets of the Arduino and afterwards put the arduino in it to solder the pins, using the motherboard as a jig.
When done it should look something like this:

##Printing the case:
###This is not on Makho's list of items needed as he didn't create the case.
You'll need 3x M3 5-8mm thread screws 
(in these pictures V2 of the case is shown, in the links below you'll find later versions.)

Place the pcb in the bottom parts with the 2 switches first.
