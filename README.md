# Currently this is still a WIP as I'm still building and waiting for parts, this should get you on your way however.

## First I want to state that I create nothing but the 3d files for the case!
See this as a buildguide for myself in the future in case I want to recreate it.

Makho's Instructional video how he created this: (All links below for Makho can be found in the description of the video)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCagzAQVYlU (I recommend using sockets for everything if you're going to follow the video so that it will fit the case)

Makho's list of materials needed:
(For Female sockets I've used standard rows which I cut to length, detailed later)

The Gerber files should be 1.6mm. I payed 12.3‚Ç¨ incl shipping to Europe for 5.

## Once everything is arrived from the list it's time to start building. 
### Soldering the underside.
The first thing you should do is attach the resistors or the buttons won't work. 
10k ohm resistor with code 103.

Because afterwards it can get crowded:

For the oled screen you must set the jumpers depending on your model.
My screen was GND-VCC-SCL-SDA

![This is an image](https://imgur.com/F35PndN.jpeg)

JP2 should be set to GND and JP1 to VCC as show below. If yours is switched, you should switch the bridging:

- Start with the voltage regulator in red.
- The USB C charging port (which is missing because I forgot to order it)

For all sockets I've cut them to length and used coarse (80grit) sandpaper to have flush ends.

- The sockets for the sd card depending on your model, I have a MicroSD
- The sockets for the Arduino (If you're not gonna use sockets, this is the time for the buttons else can be done later)
- The buttons (check orientation in able to fit the case)
- The battery terminals
It should look something like this:

The 5V to 3.3V step-down converter should be installed like this:
5v   in
3.3v out

For the sd cardreader I've chosen to not bend the pins but to solder straight pins in:

### Soldering the top
If you haven't soldered in the buttons yet, now is the time.
There are multiple choices for buttons, I went with what I had laying around. Ajazz Bananas in this case.
Solder the following components:
- 4-pin socket for the Oled screen
- The Led (The longest lead goes through the hole marked VCC)
- The GB cart slot
If you're finished it should look something like:

### Populating the board.

I put the pins in the sockets of the Arduino and afterwards put the arduino in it to solder the pins, using the motherboard as a jig.
When done it should look something like this:

## Printing the case:
### This is not on Makho's list of items needed as he didn't create the case.
You'll need 3x M3 5-8mm thread screws 
(in these pictures V2 of the case is shown, in the links below you'll find later versions.)

You can choose either links:

Place the pcb in the bottom parts with the 2 switches first.

# Flashing the Arduino

You can follow the Sanni Guidelines:
https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki/User-Guide

The only thing you have to keep in mind is that you have to define the HW model as HW3
and that you can comment most other systems as it can only read GBx games.

# Using the device

In the guidelines of Sanni you can find the full behaviour of the buttons:
https://github.com/sanni/cartreader/wiki/User-Guide 

Below is a snippet of their info:

‚ôªÔ∏è Button 1

    Press once to move the selection down.
    Double-click to move the selection up.
    Hold longer to execute current selection.
    While inside the filebrowser you can go to the next page by moving the selection down once more after you reached the last item on the current page.
    In a similar fashion you can go back one page by double-clicking while the first item is selected.
    You can enter a folder by holding button 1 pressed longer.
    You can go back to the SD's root folder by double-clicking until you reach the first selection of the first page and then double-clicking once more.

üî¥ Button 2

    Press to execute current selection.
    When in filebrowser mode enters a directory.
